                <p>
                    When exercising your rights or otherwise assisting you, we may need to request specific information
                    from you to help us confirm your identity. This is a security measure to ensure we do not disclose
                    personal information to any person who is not entitled to receive it. We may also contact you to ask
                    you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. You may also
                    designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. If you do so, we may require the
                    requester’s proof of identification, the authorized agent’s proof of identification, and any other
                    information that we may request in order to verify your request, including evidence of valid
                    permission for the authorized agent to act on your behalf. You will not have to pay a fee to access
                    your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
                    reasonable fee or decline to comply with your request if your request is clearly unfounded,
                    repetitive, or excessive. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within 45 days of your
                    request. Occasionally it may take us longer than 45 days to respond, for instance if your request is
                    particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you of the
                    delay, and may continue to update you regarding the progress of our response.
