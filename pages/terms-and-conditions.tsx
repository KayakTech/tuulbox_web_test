                    says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to
                    exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially
                    affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive
                    any comparable statute or doctrine.

                <p className="text-gray-400 tb-title-body-medium">
                    At Tuulbox’s or your election, all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating to
                    the Terms of Service or the Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved by
                    binding arbitration to be conducted before JAMS, or its successor. Unless otherwise agreed by the
                    parties, arbitration will be held in Oakland, California before a single arbitrator mutually agreed
                    upon by the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, a single arbitrator appointed by JAMS,
                    and will be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated by JAMS unless
                    specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45)
                    days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The
                    arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within sixty (60) days of the conclusion
                    of the arbitration and within six (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will
                    not have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual compensatory, direct
                    damages set forth in the Terms of Service and may not multiply actual damages or award punitive
                    damages or any other damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Service, and each
                    party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The arbitrator may, in his or her
                    discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the
                    prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of
                    the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the
                    other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or
                    preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the
                    purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will
                    be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the provisions of the
                    introductory section above, if tuulbox changes this ‘Arbitration’ section after the date you first
                    accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service ), you
                    may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change
                    became effective, as indicated in the “Date of Last Revision” date above or in the date of Tuulbox’s
                    email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will
                    arbitrate any dispute between you and tuulbox in accordance with the provisions of this section as
                    of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent changes to these
                    Terms of Service).

                    affiliate or third party services, third party content or third party software. These Terms of
                    Service will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of
                    law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth
                    above, you and tuulbox agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and
                    federal courts located within Alameda County, California. The failure of tuulbox to exercise or
                    enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such right
                    or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent
                    jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give
                    effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these
                    Terms of Service remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to
                    the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service or these
                    Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be
                    forever barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will
                    be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to
                    the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records
                    originally generated and maintained in printed form. You may not assign this Terms of Service
                    without the prior written consent of tuulbox, but tuulbox may assign or transfer this Terms of
                    Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are
                    for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either
                    email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of
